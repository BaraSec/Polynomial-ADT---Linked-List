# Polynomial ADT - Linked List

This was my solution to a Data Structures course's first project in a CS Bachelor program I am pursuing. It's an application based on the Linked List Data Structure.

The project's description that was sent to the course's students is available at `Description/COMP242-Project1.pdf`.
